# boot-create-html

A Boot task to generate html from edn files.

## Usage

To use this in your project, add `[poyo.co/boot-create-html "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT" :scope "boot"]` to your `:dependencies`
and then require the task:

    (require '[boot-create-html.core :refer [create-html]])

Create a `.html.edn` file in `resources/` relative to where you'd like the HTML generated.
The edn should contain **at least** a `:template` key which is a symbol referenceing the function required to generate the HTML.
